# Text Understanding from Scratch

Summative Project for course: COMP 551 - Applied Machine Learning, at McGill University

Completed: April 2018

Task Objective:

"Improve the baselines - When people propose new models, they often spend more time on fine-tuning their proposed model than fine-tuning the baselines. Simple baselines like Naive Bayes, Random Forests, k-NN, if properly tuned, can be sometimes too strong to beat. In this track, your goal will be to select a paper from the given list and improve the baseline for the tasks considered in the paper. First implement the baselines mentioned in the paper and try to reproduce the baseline performance reported in the paper. Then try to finetune the baselines by doing extensive hyper-parameter tuning. Then, explore simple machine learning algorithms to improve the performance in the given task. Your job is to act like an adversary to the paper and try to beat their performance by using simple algorithms which has lesser computational complexity."
